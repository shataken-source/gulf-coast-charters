# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) User Guide

## What is 2FA?

Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring two forms of verification:
1. **Something you know** - Your password
2. **Something you have** - Your phone with an authenticator app

## How to Enable 2FA

### Step 1: Go to Profile Settings
1. Log in to your account
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right
3. Select "Profile Settings"
4. Scroll to the "Security" section

### Step 2: Start 2FA Setup
1. Click the "Enable" button next to "Two-Factor Authentication"
2. Click "Start Setup" in the modal that appears

### Step 3: Scan QR Code
1. Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
2. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
3. Alternatively, manually enter the secret key shown below the QR code

### Step 4: Verify Setup
1. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
2. Click "Verify & Enable"

### Step 5: Save Backup Codes
1. **IMPORTANT**: Download and save your 10 backup codes
2. Store them in a secure location (password manager, safe place)
3. These codes can be used if you lose access to your authenticator app
4. Click "Done" to complete setup

## How to Login with 2FA

### Normal Login
1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. Click "Login"
3. A verification screen will appear
4. Open your authenticator app
5. Enter the current 6-digit code
6. Click "Verify"
7. You're now logged in!

### Using a Backup Code
If you don't have access to your authenticator app:
1. On the verification screen, click "Use backup code"
2. Enter one of your saved backup codes
3. Click "Verify"
4. **Note**: Each backup code can only be used once

## Recommended Authenticator Apps

### Mobile Apps
- **Google Authenticator** (iOS/Android) - Simple and reliable
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS/Android) - Supports backup
- **Authy** (iOS/Android) - Multi-device sync
- **1Password** (iOS/Android) - Integrated with password manager

### Desktop Apps
- **Authy** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **1Password** (Windows/Mac)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid code" error
- **Time sync issue**: Ensure your device time is set to automatic
- **Wrong code**: Codes change every 30 seconds, try the next one
- **Old code**: Make sure you're using the current code, not an expired one

### Lost access to authenticator app
1. Use one of your backup codes to log in
2. Go to Profile Settings
3. Disable 2FA
4. Set up 2FA again with a new device

### Lost backup codes
If you've lost both your authenticator app AND backup codes:
- Contact support for account recovery
- You'll need to verify your identity

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Save backup codes in a secure location
- Use a reputable authenticator app
- Keep your authenticator app updated
- Enable 2FA on all important accounts

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share your backup codes with anyone
- Take screenshots of QR codes (security risk)
- Use SMS-based 2FA if TOTP is available
- Ignore backup codes - you WILL need them eventually

## Disabling 2FA

If you need to disable 2FA:
1. Log in to your account (you'll need your 2FA code)
2. Go to Profile Settings
3. Find the "Two-Factor Authentication" section
4. Click "Disable"
5. Confirm the action

**Warning**: Disabling 2FA makes your account less secure.

## Security Tips

1. **Use unique passwords**: 2FA is most effective with a strong, unique password
2. **Enable on critical accounts**: Prioritize email, banking, and primary accounts
3. **Regular backups**: Periodically check that you still have access to backup codes
4. **Multiple devices**: Consider using Authy for multi-device support
5. **Recovery plan**: Have a plan for device loss or failure
