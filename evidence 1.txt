RECREATION LOG - NOVEMBER 24, 2025

Today I spent approximately 10-12 hours recreating work 
for my Gulf Coast Charters platform that was lost overnight 
between November 23-24.

Work recreated included:
- Bug fixes for the booking system
- Platform features and components  
- Deployment configurations
- Database corrections
- Various files and code

Time spent: 10-12 hours
Rate: $150/hour professional developer rate
Value: $1,500 - $1,800

This recreation was necessary because Claude.ai's system 
lost all my work between the evening of November 23 and 
morning of November 24, 2025.
