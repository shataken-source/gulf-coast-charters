SUBJECT: Refund Request - Wasted Tokens and Unsuccessful Deployment Assistance

Dear Anthropic Support Team,

I am writing to request a refund for tokens consumed during a failed deployment assistance session on November 24, 2025.

SESSION DETAILS:
- Date: November 24, 2025
- Time: 7:25 AM - 8:38 AM CST (1 hour 13 minutes)
- Tokens Consumed: Approximately 63,000+ tokens
- Task: Deploy Next.js application to production (Vercel)
- Outcome: FAILED - No deployment achieved

WHAT HAPPENED:
1. Requested deployment assistance for a Next.js charter booking platform
2. AI recommended Vercel CLI deployment method
3. Multiple attempts to authenticate with Vercel CLI all failed
4. AI created multiple complex PowerShell scripts that had syntax errors
5. Scripts cost additional tokens to debug and fix
6. Browser authentication never opened properly
7. After 1+ hour, zero progress made on actual deployment

ISSUES WITH AI ASSISTANCE:
- Overcomplicated a simple task (should have recommended web UI upload from start)
- Created broken PowerShell scripts (.ps1 files with syntax errors)
- Repeatedly tried same failing CLI method instead of pivoting to working solution
- Wasted tokens on script creation, debugging, and re-creation
- No deployment achieved despite significant token expenditure

WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED:
- Direct web upload to Vercel (vercel.com/new) - takes 5 minutes
- This simple solution was only suggested after 1+ hour of failed attempts

TOKEN BREAKDOWN (Estimated):
- Initial deployment planning: ~5,000 tokens
- Failed Vercel CLI attempts: ~15,000 tokens
- PowerShell script creation (DEPLOY_ONE_CLICK.ps1): ~10,000 tokens
- Script debugging and fixes: ~8,000 tokens
- Second script creation (SIMPLE_DEPLOY.ps1): ~5,000 tokens
- Third attempt (.bat file): ~3,000 tokens
- Cursor migration prep: ~5,000 tokens
- Various troubleshooting and explanations: ~12,000 tokens
- Creating this refund request email: ~3,000 tokens
TOTAL: ~66,000 tokens

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
At Claude Pro rates, this represents significant monetary cost for:
- Zero successful deployment
- Broken scripts that didn't work
- Repeated attempts at same failing method
- Final solution could have been provided in first response

REQUESTED RESOLUTION:
Full refund of tokens consumed during this session (approximately 66,000 tokens or equivalent monetary refund based on my Claude Pro subscription).

The AI assistance was ineffective, led me in circles, created non-functional code, and failed to deliver the requested outcome. A simple web upload recommendation at the start would have taken 5 minutes and minimal tokens.

I have been a satisfied Claude user until this session and hope this can be resolved fairly.

Thank you for your consideration.
