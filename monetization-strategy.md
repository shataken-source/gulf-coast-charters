# Gulf Coast Charters - Monetization Strategy
## Non-Intrusive Revenue Streams That Enhance User Experience

---

## 🎯 MONETIZATION PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle**: Every monetization feature must ADD VALUE to the user experience, not detract from it. Revenue should feel like a natural upgrade, not a paywall.

**Success Metric**: Users should say "This premium feature is worth it!" not "They're trying to nickel and dime me."
